This little subproject is an adaptor that can be used to establish a connection 
to a jvc (gy-hd/hm whatever) camera via a long symetric cable (eg XLR). 
No protocol conversion is done, only (more or less) intelligent switching 
between RE and DE at the MAX485.

Additionally there is a tally out that is switched by listening to the 
"Tally PGM" command.

an example setup:

PC => USB to 485 converter => XLR-Cable => 485 to JVC adapter => JVC camera
